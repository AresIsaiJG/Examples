# Example: Bit-Field, Unions and Structures to define Registers in C
This example demonstrates:
* The use of bit-field structures to access specific bits of a register. 
* It demonstrates the use of unions to access a record by bit field or by accessing the entire register. 
* It demonstrates the use of structures to declare multiple register and how to access them.
